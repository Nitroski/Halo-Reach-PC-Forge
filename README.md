While you have these modified files, you will be unable to play online. If you chose the option to backup your game files when prompted, you can restore them at any time using "revert changes" option in the batch file. If you did not choose to back up do not worry, you can verify your game cache through steam to get the original files again.

I made this at 4am because I couldn't sleep.
